# Mission-to-Mars : Web Scraping with HTML/CSS

## Project Description
This project adjusts the current web app to include all four of the Mars’s hemisphere images and to make it scraping-friendly. This project uses BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images, stores the scraped data on a Mongo database, uses a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.
